# CS255-System-Analysis-and-Design

# Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The DriverPass project is designed to help users and customers pass their driving exams better and be more safe on the road. They requested a cloud hosted web system that would allow them to create and manage appointments with driving instructors.

# What did you do particularly well?
I did well with understanding and creating diagrams for this system. It was easy to break down each issue into specific diagrams that addressed different issues.

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would like to create more diagrams if I was actually preparing to create this system. The diagrams I created are a great start to an overall system. However, more information would be needed before implementation.

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I created use cases for a lot of the user requirments. I also took advantage of the transcript with the DriverPass Client to understand the needed rewquirements. Understanding the user's needs is important because we need to make a product that they will accept and use. They will not want to pay for a system that doesn't match their vision.

# How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
Designing software in the future will require more documents surrounding the ones that have been created here. These documents help us build out a very large picture of the project and how things interact. A very very basic service could be performed that handles the functions that DriverPass wants. However, building these diagrams and documents helps us build something more substantial that will please the stake holders.
